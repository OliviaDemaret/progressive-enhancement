      <h2>The story</h2>
      <blockquote>
        <cite>
          <p>
            Once upon a time there was a Chinese farmer whose horse ran away.
            That evening, all of his neighbors came around to commiserate. They
            said, “We are so sorry to hear your horse has run away. This is most
            unfortunate.” The farmer said, “Maybe.” The next day the horse came
            back bringing seven wild horses with it, and in the evening
            everybody came back and said, “Oh, isn’t that lucky. What a great
            turn of events. You now have eight horses!” The farmer again said,
            “Maybe.”
          </p>
          <p>
            The following day his son tried to break one of the horses, and
            while riding it, he was thrown and broke his leg. The neighbors then
            said, “Oh dear, that’s too bad,” and the farmer responded, “Maybe.”
            The next day the conscription officers came around to conscript
            people into the army, and they rejected his son because he had a
            broken leg. Again all the neighbors came around and said, “Isn’t
            that great!” Again, he said, “Maybe.”
          </p>
          <p>
            whole process of nature is an integrated process of immense
            complexity, and it’s really impossible to tell whether anything that
            happens in it is good or bad — because you never know what will be
            the consequence of the misfortune; or, you never know what will be
            the consequences of good fortune.

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>
        Good and Bad are just one perspective. Bananas are good for monkeys, but
        monkeys are not good for bananas. Let's not make a big deal out of it...
